# fluffy-Real-Estate
A course based project on Online Real Estate Business Portal using Software Engineering methodologies
AIM
The aim of the online real estate business project is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly 
platform that connects buyers, sellers, and real estate agents in a virtual marketplace. The primary 
goal is to streamline the process of buying, selling, and renting properties, making it more efficient 
and accessible for users while providing them with a reliable and secure environment. 
PROBLEM STATEMENT
With the increase in the number of transactions at a branch, the total workload of the staff has 
become so big that the company is employing more staff to handle the ever increasing amount of 
paper work. There is also a legal requirement to produce detailed monthly, quarterly and annual 
reports. Management also needs summarized statistical data in order to have access to all the data 
pertinent to a decision. Inferential statistics always act as a tool to have a look at all the data of an 
organization in a precise, summarized form. Clearly, the manual system is inadequate for this type 
of work. The file system was originally developed in response to the needs of the company for more 
efficient data access. However, this kind of system has the following disadvantages. 
i. Data is isolated making it more difficult to access. 
ii. Most data items handled by more than one department are duplicated in each department 
leading to the wastage of time and resources. 
iii. The data is not secure since any time the files can be stolen or can catch fire. 
To become more effective, a computer-based information system can act as the most efficient way 
to handle all the information needs of Property Masters, using a database and a database 
management system. The advantages of using a computer in a management information system are: 
i. When used as a data storage and retrieval device, the computer acts as the data librarian. 
ii. The computer provides processing capabilities for the production of information. 
iii. The computer serves as a communication device to obtain data or information from other 
computers. 
iv. The computer provides information by producing tables, reports, charts, graphs, and 
formatted documents. 
v. Statistical data can be easily analyzed using a computer.
